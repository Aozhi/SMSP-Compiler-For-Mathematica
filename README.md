# SMSP-Compiler-For-Mathematica
SMSP(Standard Musical String Protocol) is a set of rules about how to translate string into music. This project is a Mathematica programming realization(compiler) about this idea. Using this compiler, you can convert the TXT inputs into music files such as MID or WAV.

About the grammar details of SMSP and how to use this compiler to create music, please see that DOCX file.

About the examples of using this compiler to create real music works, you can check on 例子.nb, which shows the compiler outputs of 5 SMSP project files: helloworld.txt, 字母歌.txt, 字母歌KS.txt, 幻化成风.txt and AlphaChord示范曲.txt. The last one was made by LePtC, you can check on the profile of his AlphaChord project: https://github.com/LePtC/AlphaChord/blob/master/v0.2.2

beats.txt and chords.txt are include files of these projects, which was also made by LePtC. Thank you so much for your great contribution to SMSP.
